# Grammar for Comments in Pascal

The files `pascal.maude` and  `pascal-cut.maude` define the grammar for
comments in ISO 7185 and ISO 10206 Pascal with and without cuts.

## Valid files
The input (valid) files are in the directory `./yes`. Those files were manually
generated exploiting the fact that comments are allowed to be opened with `(* `
and closed with `}`.


## Results
Executing the file `exec.maude`, it is possible to obtain the results for all
test cases. The summary is in [results.ods](results.ods) (also in
[results.csv](results.csv)).
