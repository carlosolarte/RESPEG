## Benchmarks and examples

This directory contains some examples of grammars as well as benchmarks on
valid and invalid input files. 

 - [anbncn](./anbncn):  tests on the language `a^n b^n c^n`
 - [pascal](./pascal): comments in the style of Pascal
 - [c89](./c89): Ansi C 
 - [json](./json): grammar for JSON
 - [pallene](./pallene): An extension of Lua. 

In [mutation](./mutation) there is a simple script in Python3 to generate new
benchmarks: invalid files from valid ones by deleting, inserting and
substituting characters.
