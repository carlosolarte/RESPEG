# Grammar for Pallene

The files `pallene.maude` and  `pallene-cut.maude` define the grammar for the language 
[Pallene](https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene) with and without cuts.  

## Benchmark 
We considered the valid and non-valid Titan/Pallene programs in this 
[repository](https://github.com/sqmedeiros/pegparser/tree/master/test/titan). Valid files are in the directory `yes` and non-valid inputs in `no`.

## Results
Executing the file `exec.maude`, it is possible to obtain the results for all
test cases. The summary is in [results.ods](results.ods) (also in
[results.csv](results.csv)).
